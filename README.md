# KAT-TOOLS
Actually I don't know how I find this Project! A long before I was working on the updates for this Tool https://kpstvhub.com/blog/2017/03/07/kat/

But Suddenly I don't know what happened to me, and I move on to some other Projects. Now after a long time maybe a year later I found this project in my Vs Studio Projects. So Decided to Upload Directly to GIT for a reference.

So the Thing is, if anyone wants to work on this project, you can use is modify it, redistribute it under GNU License. And if you find this helpful! try to buy me a beer ;)

# Build
To build it, Just clone this Repo! Open this Project in VS Studio > Change Solution Configurations to 'Release' (if not) > Build Solution

If building has some problem like no assembly found, then there is a folder 'libs' containing all assemblies of it. Add it to Solution if necessary. If you get some other problems, create an Issue here!
